#### About

The Avery Dennison Foundation Spirit of Invention Scholarship Award is an initiative by the Avery Dennison Foundation and IIE (Institute of International Education).

##### My Idea

While I was contemplating how to contribute to the competition, I traveled to the state of Karnataka in March. In the middle of summer, it was a terrible time period to be out and about (yes, I got sunburnt). On this journey, my family and I continually exhausted our drinking water resources and were left looking for more supply on long stretches of barren highways.

Personally experiencing this unavailability of drinking water inspired me to tackle this problem for the InvEnt competition. Thus, I came up with the idea of a 'Portable Solar-powered Water Purification Unit': a lightweight piece of equipment that can be carried like a backpack by travelers. The unit can be used by people on the move to purify contaminated water.

I developed the idea with more accuracy with the guidance of Dr. Malini Bapat, one of my Chemistry professors at college. After one round of essay-based selection, I traveled to New Delhi to attend an interview.

#### PART 2

As part of Day 1 of the event, we had workshops on Strategies for Influencing Others by Ms. Akanksha Takyar and Networking by Ms. Talar Shahinian.

Indulging in recalling my memories of the event through this photo gallery -

I was humbled to receive the opportunity to represent AD InvEnt 2018-19 scholars on the Trailblazers of Spirit of Invention panel discussion.
