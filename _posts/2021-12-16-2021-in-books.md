I started 2021 on the high of having read 27 books in 2020—my personal best. So maybe I was not being all too ambitious setting my Goodreads Challenge for 2021 as 50 books? In my defense, I was right on track for the first few months, reading 1 book per week, catching up with a short read every time I fell behind. Most importantly, it was helping me set a rhythm, a good routine of browsing through books and creating a healthy catalogue of books I wish to read. Unfortunately, due to other commitments I faced a reading drought for nearly three months. Which is fine, if you were to ask me. I would never forcefully get through a book, the activity is way too precious for that. With all said and done, I am ending my year having completed my challenge with a mighty score of 27 / 50 books!

All 27 books were beautiful to me, but in this blog I want to list 12 books (reversing '21) that really left a mark on me. Here goes!

4. Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 by Cho Nam-Joo, Jamie Chang (Translator)
5. And the Mountains Echoed by Khaled Hosseini
6. The Housekeeper and the Professor by Yōko Ogawa
