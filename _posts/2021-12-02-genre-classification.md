#### About

As part of this project, I worked on exploring stylistic tendencies for book summarization.

Mainly, I was involved in
* Part-of-Speech tagging using Stanford Tagger in Java
* Data Preprocessing for the CMU and Brown Corpus
* Feature Investigation using Visualisation
* Clustering to derive a Genre Category Score
* Genre Classification for shorter text documents ranging from 150 - 600 words in length
