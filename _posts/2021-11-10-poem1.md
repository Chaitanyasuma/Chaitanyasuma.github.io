[I] <br />
at ten I learnt to ride the bicycle, the wind always on my trails <br />
i squinted and agonised and scraped both knees <br />
but as my menacing bicycle grew alongside me <br />
our rides became friendly, our time together long
<br />
[II] <br />
coarse wheels displaced easy handle bars <br />  
and the touch of the bicycle became a tale as old as time. <br />
as i swerved and cussed, i never looked back <br />
smiles growing distant as miles rolled on
<br />
[III] <br />
in retrospect, my bicycle days were a wise old tree <br />
oblivious to the depth of its roots <br />
when i stepped out of my skin—bark warm to the touch— <br />
my feet planted firmly, the tree's shade followed me around <br />
<br />  
[IV] <br />
my shadows have been long, but what they say is wrong <br />
about the art of balance—step after careful step to mend my previous fall. <br />
instead my bicycle taught me lasting hope for every way forward, <br />
and to always remember to keep moving on <br />
