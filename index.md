  I care about all things data. I consider story-telling to be my best skill and data, my best friend. With previous research experience in Data mining, Data Analysis, Data Visualisation & Data Privacy, I have laid my hands on data from various sources leading to actionable insights in various domains. I am interested in further pursuing Data-driven problem solving.
