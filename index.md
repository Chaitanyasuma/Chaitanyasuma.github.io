  I believe that I thrive in environments that challenge my ability to innovate. This is an observation I have made, and a conclusion I have drawn after having delved into several problem-solving activities in the years of pursuing my education. Of these, the endeavors that excited me the most involved some form of data-based analysis and storytelling. I have extensively worked in theoretical and applied Data Visualisation, Data Privacy and Data Mining.
  Broadly, I can summarise my professional ambition using three words : Research in Data.

  I really enjoy investing my time in creative outlets. I use my ability to gadget and draw straight lines (sometimes) to indulge in graphic designing, digital art, photography, and painting. I love to read and I'm always up for good old retellings of family and friendship. And even though it requires immense courage, occassionally, I write.
